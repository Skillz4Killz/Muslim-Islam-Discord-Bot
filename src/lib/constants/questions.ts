    explanation: `Know, may Allāh have mercy upon you, that it is obligatory upon us to have knowledge of four matters:
    
    1. **Knowledge**: which is knowledge and awareness of Allāh; knowledge of His Prophet; and knowledge of the religion of Islām with the evidences.
    2. **Righteous actions**: based upon one’s knowledge.
    3. **Da’wah**: propogating it and calling to it.
    4. **Patience**: upon the harms encountered upon this way.
    
    The proof is the saying of Allāh (the Most High): "By time, indeed mankind is in loss; except those who truly believe; perform righteous deeds; encourage each other upon the truth and encourage each other with patience." [Sūrah al-‘Aṣr]

    question: "What are the 4 names of the scriptures that are confirmed?",
    explanation: `
      **Torah & Injeel**: He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book in truth, confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Injeel. [Quran Surah Ali 'Imran Ayah 3],
      
      **Zabur**: Indeed, We have sent revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, ˹as well as˺ Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And to David We gave the Zabur. [Quran Surah An-Nisa Ayah 164]

      **Quran**: Ramaḍân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful. [Quran Surah Al-Baqarah Ayah 185]

      **Unknown Scriptures**: The Qur'an also mentions other scriptures but their name is not revealed. For example: "the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses." [Quran Surah Al-A'la Ayah 19] We do not know the name of the scripture given to Ibrahim peace be upon him.

    question:
      "Which of the following is NOT one of the three matters that are obligated upon every Muslim to learn and implement?",
    explanation: `
    Know, may Allāh have mercy upon you, that it is obligatory upon every Muslim, male and female, to learn and implement the following three matters:[3]

First: That Allāh created us and provided sustenance for us; He did not leave us without a purpose, rather, He sent a Messenger to us. So whoever obeys him will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the Fire.

The proof is the saying of the Most High: "Indeed We have sent a Messenger to you, just as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh denied and rejected the Messenger, so We seized him with a severe punishment." [73:15-16]

Second: Allāh is not pleased that anyone should be made a partner with Him in worship, neither any close angel, or any Prophet sent as a Messenger.

The proof is the saying of Allāh (the Most High): "The places of worship are for Allāh alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allāh." [72: 18]

Third: Whoever is obedient to the Messenger and directs all worship to Allāh alone, upon Tawḥīd, then it is not permissible for him to have love, alliance and support for those who oppose Allāh and His Messenger, even if they are those most closely related to him.

The proof is the saying of Allāh (the Most High): "You will not find a people who believe in Allāh and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allāh and His Messenger, even if they are their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsfolk. Rather Allāh has decreed true Belief for their hearts, and strengthened them with proof, light and guidance from Him; and He will enter them into the gardens of Paradise beneath whose trees rivers will flow, and they will dwell therein forever. Allāh is pleased with them and they with Him. They are the party of Allāh. Indeed the party of Allāh are the successful." [52:18]

    Also His saying (the Most High): "Your Lord is Allāh who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then ascended upon the Throne. He causes the night to cover the day which it follows with haste; and the sun, the moon and the stars are subservient and subject to His command. Certainly creation and commandment are His alone.

    answer: "Takfir (labeling as disbeliever)",
    explanation: `
    [A person must single out Allāh] in all the types of worship which Allāh commanded such as: Islām, Īmān and Iḥsān. [Also, from the types of worship:]

- Duʿā (supplication) 
- Khawf (fear)

- Istiʿādhah (seeking refuge) & Istighaathah (seeking rescue)

The proof for this is His saying (the Most High): "And the Masājid (places of worship) are for Allāh alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allāh"."[72:18]

Anyone who directs any [act of worship] to other than Allāh is a person who has committed polytheism and disbelief. The proof of this is His saying: "Whoever worships along with Allāh any other object of worship has no proof for that; his reckoning will be with his Lord. Indeed the unbelievers will never prosper."

      `To worship Allah as if you can see Allah, and if you can not see Allah then knowing that Allah can see you.`,
    ],
    answer: `To worship Allah as if you can see Allah, and if you can not see Allah then knowing that Allah can see you.`,
    explanation: `
    The proof for the testimony is the saying of the Most High: "Allāh bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Him; and likewise the angels and the people of knowledge bear witness: He who maintains justice, none has the right to be worshipped but Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." [03:18]  

    [MEANING OF THE FIRST TESTIMONY]

The meaning [of the testimony] is: ‘none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh’.

“Laa Ilaaha” negating the right of everything being worshipped besides Allāh. ‘‘Illa Allāh’’ affirming worship for Allāh alone; He has no partners in His Kingdom.

The explanation which will make it clear is the saying of Allāh (the Most High): "When Ibrāhīm said to his father and his people: 'Verily, I am free what you worship, except He who created me, and surely, He will guide me. And he [Allāh] made it a Word lasting among his offspring, that they may turn back (in repentance to Allāh).'" [43:26]

"Say:'O people of the Book: Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allāh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allāh. Then, if they turn away, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.''" [03:64]

The proof for the testimony that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh, is the saying of Allāh: "There has indeed come to you Allāh’s Messenger, from amongst yourselves and known to you. It grieves him that you should suffer. He is eager and anxious for the guidance of those of you who are astray, and that they should repent and return to the truth, and he is full of compassion and mercy for the Believers." [09:128]

[MEANING OF THE SECOND TESTIMONY]

The meaning of the testification that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh is: to obey him in whatever he commands; to accept everything he informed of as being the truth; to avoid everything he forbade; and that you worship Allāh only with that which he legislated.’

[EVIDENCES FOR THE PILLARS OF ISLĀM]

The proof for Ṣalāh, Zakāt and the explanation of Tawḥīd is the saying of Allāh: "They were not commanded except that they should worship Allāh alone; making their worship and obedience purely for Him, upon the true Religion and free from Shirk; and that they should establish the Ṣalāh (Prayer) and pay the Zakāt, and that is the straight and true Religion." [98:05]

The evidence for Fasting is the saying of the Most High: "O you who believe Fasting is prescribed as an obligation for you as it was prescribed as an obligation for those who came before you, so that you may attain Taqwā, obedience to Allāh and avoidance of whatever He has forbidden." [02:183]

The evidence for Ḥajj is the His saying (the Most High): "And Ḥajj to Allāh’s sacred House is an obligation upon those able to perform it; and whoever refuses and rejects the obligation of Ḥajj to Allāh’s House, then Allāh has no need of him or of any of the creation." [04:97]

    ],
    answer: "Believe in Salah",
    explanation: `
    Its pillars are six, as is mentioned in the Ḥadīth: “Īmān is to believe in Allāh, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the Decree - the good and bad of it.”

The proof for these six pillars is the saying of Allāh: "It is not righteousness that you turn your faces to the east nor the west, but rather righteousness is the righteousness of those who truly believe in Allāh, and the Last Day, and the Angels and the Books and the Prophets." [02:177]

The proof for Decree is His saying (the Most High): "We have created all things in accordance with a pre-decreed measure." [54:49]

    ],
    answer: `It is to worship Allāh as if you see Him and if you do not see him, then He sees you.`,
    explanation: `
    The third level is Iḥsān (Perfection of Worship); it has only one pillar as has been mentioned in the Ḥadīth: “It is to worship Allāh as if you see Him and if you do not see him, then He sees you.” 7

    The proof of this is His saying: "Truly, Allāh is with those who fear Him and those who are do Iḥsān (all types of good)." [16:128]
    
    Also, the saying of Allāh: "Put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful, who sees you when you stand up and your movements among those who fall prostrate. Verily! He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower." [26:217]

    He is: Muḥammad the son of ʿAbdullāh, the son of ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, the son of Hāshim, the son of Quraysh who are from the Arabs. The Arabs are from the offspring of Ismāʿīl, the son of Ibrāhīm the Khalīl (Beloved) - may peace and blessings be on him and our Prophet.

    The Prophet  lived 63 years, 40 of those years were before Prophethood and 23 years as a Messenger and Prophet. [Through the revelation of Sūrah] ‘Iqraʾ’ he became a Prophet, and [through the revelation of Sūrah] ‘Muddathir’ he became a Messenger. His birth-city was Mecca and he migrated to Medina.

    Allāh sent him to warn against Shirk and to call to Tawḥīd. The proof of this is the saying of the Most High: "O you enveloped in garments, arise and warn! Exalt your Lord! Purify your garments! keep away from ar-Rujz. Give not a thing in order to have more. Be patient for the sake of your Lord." [74:01-07]
    
    The meaning of ‘arise and warn’ is: warn against Shirk and call to Tawḥīd. The meaning of ‘Exalt your Lord’ is: exalt Him with Tawḥīd. The meaning of ‘purify your garments’ is: purify your deeds from Shirk. The meaning of ‘keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)’ is: Ar-Rujz are the idols; keep away from them is by leaving them, disassociating from them the people who are associated with them.
    
    In implementing this (the above Āyat), the Prophet  spent ten years calling to Tawḥīd. After ten years he was taken to the Heavens and the five daily Ṣalāh (Prayers) were obligated upon him. He prayed in Mecca for three years.

    question: "What is Hijrah?",
    choices: [
      "Migrating from the land of Islām to the land of Shirk.",
      "Migrating from the land of Islām to the land of Islām.",
      "Migrating from the land of Shirk to the land of Islām.",
      "Migrating from the land of Shirk to the land of Shirk.",
    ],
    answer: "Migrating from the land of Shirk to the land of Islām.",
    explanation: `
    He was then ordered to make Hijrah (migration) to Medina.[10] Hijrah is: ‘migrating from the land of Shirk to the land of Islām.’ Hijrah is compulsory on this Ummah from the land of Shirk to the land of Islām. This ruling will remain thus until the establishment of the Hour.

    The proof is the saying of the Most High: "Those people whom the angels take while they are wronging themselves, the angels say: ‘In what condition were you?" They will reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ The angels will say: ‘Was not the earth of Allāh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. For these there is hope that Allāh will forgive them, and Allāh is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving." [04:97-99]

    Also, His saying: "O My slaves who believe, verily My earth is spacious so worship Me." [29:56]

Al-Baghawī ? said: “This Āyah was revealed regarding the Muslims in Mecca who did not migrate. Allāh called them believers.”

The proof of the Hijrah from the Sunnah is: “Hijrah will not cease until Tawbah (repentance) ceases, and Tawbah will not cease until the sun rises from the west.”

    question: "What is a Taghut?",
    answer:
      "An object that is worshipped, followed or obeyed and the people exceed the limits with regards to it; there are many false deities.",
    choices: [
      "Migrating from the land of Shirk to the land of Islām.",
      "An object that is worshipped, followed or obeyed and the people exceed the limits with regards to it; there are many false deities.",
      "Believe in the Last Day and the Decree - the good and bad of it.",
      "To worship Allah as if you can see Allah, and if you can not see Allah then knowing that Allah can see you.",
    ],
    explanation: `
    Allāh has made it compulsory on all His worshippers that they reject the Ṭāghūt (false deities) and worship Allāh.

    Ibn al-Qayyim ? said: "A Ṭāghūt is an object that is worshipped, followed or obeyed and the people exceed the limits with regards to it; there are many false deities."
    
    The heads [of the Ṭāghūt] are five:
      - Iblīs the accursed.
      - He who is worshipped whilst being pleased with this.
      - He who calls people to worship him.
      - A person who claims that he knows something from the future.
      - A person who rules by that which Allāh has not revealed.

The proof is the statement of Allāh the Most High: "There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Ṭāghūt and believes in Allāh, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allāh is All-Hearer, AllKnower." [02:156]

This is the meaning of ‘Lā ilāha illa Allāh.’
